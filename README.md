# handwriting_to_text
Hello! If you are here, chances are that you are grading my paper. This Git repository is a mess! I was in a HURRY trying to get everything turned in on time, so I apologize. Just so the program stays working (the !wget's and such), I am not going to clean up or move around the files in this repo. Instead, I am going to make a new repository named HandwritingToText. That is going to be the one with the nice formatting, and it's where all my future work will go too.
